    <h2>About the System</h2>
    <p>
      The Prison Information Management System is designed to meet the growing needs of correctional facilities in the Central Ethiopia Region, including the Gurage, Silte, Kambata Tambaro, Halaba, Hadiya zones, and the Yem Special Woreda. These areas have experienced an increase in criminal activity, resulting in a higher number of inmates in various prisons. Currently, the region's prison system faces challenges in managing and tracking inmate data, rehabilitation programs, and security measures effectively due to outdated and partially manual methods.
